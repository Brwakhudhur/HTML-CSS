    <p> <strong>Author:</strong> Ali Smith </p>

    <p> <strong>Description:</strong> </p>

    <p> The first of four novels in a shape-shifting series, wide-ranging in timescale
      and light-footed through histories. Fusing Keatsian mists and mellow fruitfulness
      with the vitality, the immediacy and the colour-hit of Pop Art--via a bit of
      very contemporary skulduggery and skull-diggery-- Autumn is a witty excavation
      of the present by the past. The novel is a stripped-branches take on popular
      culture, and a meditation, in a world growing ever more bordered and exclusive,
      on what richness and worth are, what harvest means. Autumn is part of the quartet
      Seasonal: four stand-alone novels, separate yet interconnected and cyclical
      (as the seasons are), exploring what time is, how we experience it, and the
      recurring markers in the shapes our lives take and in our ways with narrative.

    <p> <strong>Author:</strong>Tara Westover </p>

    <p> <strong>Description:</strong> </p>



    <p>Tara Westover was seventeen when she first set foot in a classroom. Instead of
      traditional lessons, she grew up learning how to stew herbs into medicine,
      scavenging in the family scrap yard and helping her family prepare for the
      apocalypse. She had no birth certificate and no medical records and had never
      been enrolled in school.

    </p>
    <p>Westover’s mother proved a marvel at concocting folk remedies for many ailments.
      As Tara developed her own coping mechanisms, little by little, she started
      to realize that what her family was offering didn’t have to be her only education.
      Her first day of university was her first day in school—ever—and she would
      eventually win an esteemed fellowship from Cambridge and graduate with a PhD
      in intellectual history and political thought.</p>

    <p> <strong>Author:</strong>Moshin Hamid</p>

    <p> <strong>Description:</strong> </p>

    <p>In a country teetering on the brink of civil war, two young people meet—sensual,
      fiercely independent Nadia and gentle, restrained Saeed. They embark on a furtive
      love affair, and are soon cloistered in a premature intimacy by the unrest
      roiling their city. When it explodes, turning familiar streets into a patchwork
      of checkpoints and bomb blasts, they begin to hear whispers about doors—doors
      that can whisk people far away, if perilously and for a price. As the violence
      escalates, Nadia and Saeed decide that they no longer have a choice. Leaving
      their homeland and their old lives behind, they find a door and step through.
      . . .</p>

    <p>Exit West follows these remarkable characters as they emerge into an alien and
      uncertain future, struggling to hold on to each other, to their past, to the
      very sense of who they are. Profoundly intimate and powerfully inventive, it
      tells an unforgettable story of love, loyalty, and courage that is both completely
      of our time and for all time.</p>

    <p> <strong>Description:</strong> </p>

    <p>TIn 1922, Count Alexander Rostov is deemed an unrepentant aristocrat by a Bolshevik
      tribunal, and is sentenced to house arrest in the Metropol, a grand hotel across
      the street from the Kremlin. Rostov, an indomitable man of erudition and wit,
      has never worked a day in his life, and must now live in an attic room while
      some of the most tumultuous decades in Russian history are unfolding outside
      the hotel’s doors. Unexpectedly, his reduced circumstances provide him entry
      into a much larger world of emotional discovery. </p>
    <p>Brimming with humor, a glittering cast of characters, and one beautifully rendered
      scene after another, this singular novel casts a spell as it relates the count’s
      endeavor to gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be a man of purpose.</p>

      <p> <strong>Description:</strong> </p>

      <p>Tom Hazard has a dangerous secret. He may look like an ordinary 41-year-old,
        but because of a rare condition, he's been alive for centuries. From performing
        with Shakespeare, to exploring the high seas with Captain Cook, to sharing
        cocktails with F. Scott Fitzgerald, Tom has seen a lot. But now, after over
        400 years of reinventing himself to escape detection, he just wants an ordinary
        life. The only rule he has to follow is Don’t fall in love. </p>

      <p>When Tom catches the eye of a captivating woman named Camille at the dog park,
        everything begins to unravel. Caught between the danger of discovery and
        the desire to build a real life, Tom learns that the thing he can't have
        might just be the thing that saves him.
        <p>

          <p>A wild, bittersweet, time-travelling story, How to Stop Time is about losing
            and finding yourself, about the certainty of change, about the perils
            of love and about the mistakes that humans are doomed to repeat. It asks
            the question, How many lifetimes does it take to learn how to live?

    <p> <strong>Description:</strong> </p>

    <p> Widowed by her husband’s death from the pestilence, Lady Anne assumes control
      of his people’s future—200 bonded serfs without rights of ownership to land.
      Strong, compassionate and resourceful—qualities she kept hidden from the husband
      she loathed and despised—Lady Anne chooses a bastard slave, Thaddeus Thurkell,
      to act as her steward. Together, they decide to quarantine Develish by bringing
      the serfs inside a defendable moat and sharing the available food amongst all.
      With this sudden overturning of the accepted social order, where serfs exist
      only to serve their lords, conflict arises when they’re given a voice. Ignorant
      of what is happening in the world outside, they wrestle with themselves, with
      God and the terrible uncertainty of their futures. They fear starvation when
      their food runs out but they fear the pestilence more. Who amongst them has
      the courage to leave the safety of the demesne in search of supplies and news?
      And how safe is anyone in Develish when an unexplained murder threatens the
      uneasy status quo?
    </p>
    <p>
      In The Last Hours Minette Walters brings all her trademark intelligence to a totally
      new timeframe—creating a vivid and powerful drama through compelling characters
      whose journey readers will be drawn to. The Last Hours is an exciting new direction

    <p>Ellie Mack was the perfect daughter. She was fifteen, the youngest of three.
      She was beloved by her parents, friends, and teachers. She and her boyfriend
      made a teenaged golden couple. She was days away from an idyllic post-exams
      summer vacation, with her whole life ahead of her. And then she was gone.</p>

    <p>Now, her mother Laurel Mack is trying to put her life back together. It’s been
      ten years since her daughter disappeared, seven years since her marriage ended,
      and only months since the last clue in Ellie’s case was unearthed. So when
      she meets an unexpectedly charming man in a café, no one is more surprised
      than Laurel at how quickly their flirtation develops into something deeper.
      Before she knows it, she’s meeting Floyd’s daughters—and his youngest, Poppy,
      takes Laurel’s breath away.
