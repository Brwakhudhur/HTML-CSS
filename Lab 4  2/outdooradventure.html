  <h3>Hiking</h3>
</div>

      <p>
        <img id="hikingMG1" src="images/hiking150/hikingmountains150.jpg" alt="">        In the United States, Canada, the Republic of Ireland, and United Kingdom,
        hiking means walking outdoors on a trail, or off trail, for recreational
        purposes. A day hike refers to a hike that can be completed in a single day.
        However, in the United Kingdom, the word walking is also used, as well as
        rambling, while walking in mountainous areas is called hillwalking. In Northern
        England, Including the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales, fellwalking describes
        hill or mountain walks, as fell is the common word for both features there
      </p>

      <p> <img id="hikingMG2" src="images/hiking150/winterhiker150.jpg" alt=""> Hiking
        sometimes involves bushwhacking and is sometimes referred to as such. This
        specifically refers to difficult walking through dense forest, undergrowth,
        or bushes, where forward progress requires pushing vegetation aside. In extreme
        cases of bushwhacking, where the vegetation is so dense that human passage
        is impeded, a machete is used to clear a pathway. The Australian term bushwalking
        refers to both on and off-trail hiking. Common terms for hiking used by New
        Zealanders are tramping (particularly for overnight and longer trips), walking
        or bushwalking. Trekking is the preferred word used to describe multi-day
        hiking in the mountainous regions of India, Pakistan, Nepal, North America,
        South America, Iran, and the highlands of East Africa. Hiking a long-distance
        trail from end-to-end is also referred to as trekking and as thru-hiking
        in some places. In North America, multi-day hikes, usually with camping,
        are referred to as backpacking. </p>

        <h3>Canoeing </h3>

      </div>
      
      <p>Canoeing is an activity which involves paddling a canoe with a single-bladed
        paddle. Common meanings of the term are limited to when the canoeing is the
        central purpose of the activity. Broader meanings include when it is combined
        with other activities such as canoe camping, or where canoeing is merely
        a transportation method used to accomplish other activities. Most present-day
        canoeing is done as or as a part of a sport or recreational activity. In
        some parts of Europe canoeing refers to both canoeing and kayaking, with
        a canoe being called an open canoe.</p>
      <p>Canoes are widely used for competition and pleasure, such as racing, whitewater,
        touring and camping, freestyle, and general recreation. Canoeing has been
        part of the Olympics since 1936. The intended use of the canoe dictates its
        hull shape and length and construction material. Historically, canoes were
        dugouts or made of bark on a wood frame, but construction materials evolved
        to canvas on a wood frame, then to aluminum. Most modern canoes are made
        of molded plastic or composites such as fiberglass.</p>
      <p> Canoes were developed by cultures all over the world, including some designed
        for use with sails or outriggers. Until the mid-1800s the canoe was an important
        means of transport for exploration and trade, and in some places it still
        is used as such, perhaps with the addition of an outboard motor. Where the
        canoe played a key role in history, such as the northern United States, Canada,
        and New Zealand, it remains an important theme in popular culture.</p>
